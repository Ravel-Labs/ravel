      <p>Disputes
        You and Ravel Labs each agree that any claim or dispute related in any way to these terms of service or to your

        arbitration proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a consolidated, class or
        representative action. The arbitration proceedings will be held in Atlanta, Georgia and each party will share
        the
        cost for the arbitration.

        jurisdiction of said court; and to waive any right to a jury trial.

        other misuse of intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>Applicable Law
        By using the site, you agree that, except to the extent inconsistent or preempted by federal law, the laws of
        the
        state of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Terms of Service and any
        claim or dispute of any kind that has arisen or may arise between you and Ravel Labs.

      </p>

      <p>Severability
        If any of the above terms of service are deemed unenforceable, void, or invalid, that terms shall be deemed
        severable and shall not affect the enforceability and validity of any remaining terms of service.

      </p>
      <p>General
        No aspect of this agreement constitutes a partnership or joint venture of any kind between you and Ravel Labs,
        its
        subsidiaries, agents, employees, relevant parties, directors, advisors, shareholders, officers and / or
        affiliates.
      </p>
